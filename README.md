# Environment and Evolution Simulator

As stated in the repository's description, this is a program I wrote with my contest partner over the course of 2 months for the University of Alberta's ENCMP 100 first-year engineering programming competition in the 2019-2020 school year. It took first place in the "Applications" category for the contest.

I am fully aware that this is likely not the most efficient implementation of this concept, and that MATLAB is far from the best language for a simulation such as this one. However, these were the rules of the competition. We had to use MATLAB, and like all of the other contestants, we were also learning the language as we created the project for the competition.

I don't intend to update or to continue work on this repository going forward, and instead I am publishing it here so that anyone interested can access the code for the simulation. However, I may recreate the project in a more suitable programming language with a more suitable framework in the future someday.
